//!
//! Every gate renders against `id_sql`, the SQL expression yielding the
//! candidate's entity id as TEXT (`ae.entity_id` for the activity log, the
//! `notified` CTE's derived key for notifications). Both candidate queries
//! bind the user id as `$1` and the caller's inbox link ids as `$5`, which
