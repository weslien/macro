//! The session service: the use cases an ACP client can drive.
//!
//! One ACP session maps to one Cursor agent, created lazily on the first
//! prompt (Cursor mints an agent and its first run together). Each later
//! prompt opens a follow-up run on the same agent, so the conversation
//! accumulates server-side. A turn is: create the run, stream its events,
//! translate each into session updates, deliver them through the notifier,
//! and answer with the ACP stop reason once the stream ends.
//!
//! Concurrency: ACP turns are strictly sequential per session, and the
//! service enforces that — a second prompt while one is streaming is an
//! error, not a queue. `session/cancel` is the exception: it must land *while*
//! a turn is streaming, so cancellation state lives behind a lock the
//! streaming loop never holds across an await.
//!
//! `session/cancel` is a notification we pump into Cursor: `POST
//! /v1/agents/{id}/runs/{runId}/cancel`. The turn itself keeps reading the
//! run's stream until Cursor's terminal `result` frame (then `done`) — the
//! same way a finished run ends. Cancellation is terminal on Cursor's side;
//! that `result` is what closes the ACP prompt.
//!
//! The cancellation token never cuts a live stream short — that is the whole
//! point of the paragraph above. It ends the waits where there is nothing to
//! read: a prompt queued behind `agent_busy`, and the fallback poll, which
//! only runs because the stream is gone. Reading `GET …/runs/{run}` once more
//! after the user has stopped buys nothing a stopped turn reports anyway, so
//! the poll's wait is where a stop lands.
//!
//! The remote cancel still needs a run id, and this process only remembers
//! one for a turn it is itself streaming. A session restored after a restart,
//! or one whose run started from cursor.com, has no such memory — cancelling
//! it falls back to asking Cursor which run is current rather than silently
//! skipping the remote call. A stop that beats the run into existence has
//! nothing to fall back to, so [`CursorSessionService::prompt`] re-sends it
//! the moment the run has an id; otherwise the stop would be swallowed and
//! the turn would run to the agent's own natural end.
