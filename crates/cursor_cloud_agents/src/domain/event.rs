//! The Cursor cloud event vocabulary.
//!
//! A run's SSE stream is a sequence of `(event name, JSON payload)` records.
//! This module names every record this crate understands, in the domain's own
//! vocabulary, so the translation ([`crate::domain::translate`]) and the
//! session service never see SSE framing or raw JSON. The shapes are taken
//! from recorded live streams — the Cursor docs name the events but not their
//! payloads — so unrecognized events and unrecognized `interaction_update`
//! subtypes are preserved as [`CursorEvent::Unknown`] and
//! [`InteractionUpdate::Other`] rather than dropped: the stream must survive
//! Cursor adding vocabulary.
