//! Listing the repositories a Macro user can reach through our GitHub App.
//!
//! The forward direction of the check
//! [`InstallationTokenService`](super::InstallationTokenService) makes
//! backwards. That service starts from a repository, finds its installation
//! and asks whether the user has a claim to it; this one starts from the user,
//! finds the installations they have a claim to, and asks GitHub what each one
//! covers.
//!
//! The claim is the same in both directions - an installation the user made
//! themselves, or one made by a team they belong to - and it is still the thing
//! that keeps a caller from seeing repositories belonging to someone else who
//! happens to have installed our App.
//!
//! Reaching nothing is an empty list, not an error: a user who has installed
//! nothing is in a perfectly ordinary state.
