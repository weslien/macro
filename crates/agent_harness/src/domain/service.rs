//! The orchestrator behind every agent session: one service over the ports
//! in [`crate::domain::ports`], split by concern.
//!
//! - [`queue`]: the per-session command queue and its worker, the one-turn-
//!   in-flight invariant, and routing a command to whichever replica holds
//!   the session's actor.
//! - [`open`]: creating sessions - from a mention, from the create menu, or
//!   for an external runtime - and provisioning their egress.
//! - [`deliver`]: composing a queued action with channel context and handing
//!   it to the running agent, announcing it in the channel first.
//! - [`lifecycle`]: everything after open - control events, sandbox size,
//!   turn boundaries, teardown.
//!
//! This file holds the service type itself and its public entry points.
