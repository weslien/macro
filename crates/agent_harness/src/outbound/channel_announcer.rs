//! Announce sessions by posting into the mention's thread as the bot.
//!
//! Implements [`SessionAnnouncer`] over the channels domain's own
//! [`ChannelService`] port, so the post gets the full side-effect fan-out -
//! persistence, realtime, notifications, broker - exactly as if it came
//! through the channel API. The composition root decides which
//! `ChannelService` implementation (and side-effect stack) this wraps.
//!
//! The announcement places a structured reply target above the session's
//! magic chip. The content is composed by the lexical service — the one place
//! that builds message markdown from real Lexical nodes — so this adapter
//! never formats markdown itself.
