//! Hands out Cursor cloud agents as session "containers".
//!
//! "Container" is the port's word, not reality's: there is no sandbox here.
//! Spawning wires an in-process ACP agent (`cursor_cloud_agents::serve`) to a
//! [`PipeTransport`] over a `tokio::io::duplex`, and the actual work happens
//! on a Cursor cloud agent in Cursor's VMs. That is why the lifecycle is so
//! much smaller than Daytona's — no image, no readiness recipe, no idle
//! reaper (an idle cloud agent costs us nothing), and teardown archives the
//! agent on cursor.com rather than destroying anything.
//!
//! What does need managing is the mapping. Cursor's API has no labels, so
//! `AgentSessionId -> cursor agent` lives only in the external-session repo:
//! written the moment an agent is minted (by [`RecordingCursor`], before the
//! create call returns), read back by `resume` to pre-seed the served session
//! with `restore_session`, and deleted on teardown.
//!
//! There is no deployment-wide Cursor client here, because there is no
//! deployment-wide Cursor key: a session runs on *its owner's* account, so
//! every entry point resolves the owner's key and mints a client for that one
//! session. The manager holds only what a client is built from.
